This is a small python implementation of the game of craps. The idea was to write an algorithm that would simulate the game as played in a casino.

To run the program copy the file to a desired location.

For Linux/Mac run command from the command line :
   1. cd <module_directory> 
   2. python <module_name>

   output file is generated in the same folder as the python file.
